This project provides Fedora packages for daily snapshot builds of [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org) projects
such as [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), [lld](https://lld.llvm.org/) and many more.

The packages should at least be available for the `x86_64` Fedora rawhide version.

To get involved in this, please head over to: [https://github.com/kwk/llvm-daily-fedora-rpms](https://github.com/kwk/llvm-daily-fedora-rpms).
